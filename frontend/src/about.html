<p>Originally born and raised in Puerto Rico and moved to the States in 2013.</p><br>

<p>I started working for Legrand in 2018 as a tech support agent and then advanced to an Application Engineer role. </p> <br>

<p>I am a dotted father of two! And I love having adventures with them, like camping, visiting new parks, and cycling.</p> <br>

<p>While working for Legrand, my passion for technology ignited, so I began teaching myself programming languages like C#, Javascript, CSS, and HTML, and I continue to increase my knowledge every day. It is this drive and passion <br> that I would be great for your team!</p>
